## Warning
* Make sure to **save your account password and username** somewhere safe.
* You **cannot reset or change** them if you forget.
* If someone else has access to your machine and has computer knowledge, they can **bypass** the login — so don’t share your computer if you care about privacy.

## Note
* All your data is encrypted and saved **locally on your device.**
* Nothing is uploaded online.
* That means if you log in on another machine — even with the same username and password — your saved passwords **won’t be there.**
* It’s tied to your current device only.
* For better security, you can move or hide the app folder somewhere safe instead of keeping it on the desktop.
